# Test topology:
#
# WC1 (FED) <------\
#                   +---> WED (SSED) <----------> LEADER (FTD)
# WC2 (FED) <------/
#
# Test Steps:
# 1. Setup LEADER and wait for it becoming a leader
# 2. Setup WED as a thread sleepy child and wait for the WED becoming a child
#
# 3. Setup WC1
# 4. WC1 wakes up WED and establishs a P2P link with WED
# 5. WED pings WC1
# 6. WC1 checks the registered SRP server hosts
#
# 7. Setup WC2
# 8. WC2 wakes up WED and establishs a P2P link with WED
# 9. WED pings WC2
# 10. WC2 checks the registered SRP server hosts
#
# 11. WC1 tears down the P2P link from WED
# 12. WC2 tears down the P2P link from WED
